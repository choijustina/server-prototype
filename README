Joyce Chang (rejoyce@bu.edu) github: joooooyce
Justina Choi (choi.justina@gmail.com) github: choijustina

location on Justina's VM: /home/ubuntu/workspace/SSE
export as SSE.war file on Eclipse
re-deploy on Tomcat (delete the old one, add the new one)
to access the data to be printed: http://localhost:8080/SSE/SSE.html
to see visually appealing version: http://localhost:8080/SSE/

SseServer.java


SSE_Rabbit.java (rabbitmq version)
when exporting as a .war file, don't forget to build with the necessary libraries (i.e. com.rabbitmq)
localhost:8080/SSE/ opens the consumer with queue name "queue"
confirmation message should appear when message receieved & prints message
if "close" is sent as the message, closes consumer & connection but automatically reconnects after a few (unknown) seconds
